							<h1>World Wide Web</h1>
							<p>
								The first web browser - or browser-editor rather - was called WorldWideWeb as, 
                                after all, when it was written by Tim Berners-Lee for the NeXT Computer in 1990 
                                it was the only way to see the web. Much later it was renamed Nexus in order to 
                                save confusion between the program and the abstract information space 
                                (which is now spelled World Wide Web with spaces).

							<h1>First Discussion About HTML</h1>
							<p>
								The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called "HTML Tags", 
                                first mentioned on the Internet by Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991. It describes 
                                18 elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML. Except for 
                                the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by SGMLguid, an in-house Standard 
                                Generalized Markup Language (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. 
                                Eleven of these elements still exist in HTML 4.

								Lynx was a product of the Distributed Computing Group within Academic Computing 
                                Services of the University of Kansas, and was initially developed in 1992 
                                by a team of students and staff at the university (Lou Montulli, Michael Grobe 
                                and Charles Rezac) as a hypertext browser used solely to distribute campus information 
                                as part of a Campus-Wide Information Server and for browsing the Gopher space. 
                                Beta availability was announced to Usenet on 22 July 1992.

								Netscape Navigator was inspired by the success of the Mosaic web browser, which was

                                Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois. Netscape announced in its 
                                first press release (13 October 1994) that it would make Navigator available without 
                                charge to all non-commercial users, and beta versions of version 1.0 and 1.1 were indeed 
                                freely downloadable in November 1994 and March 1995, with the full version 1.0 available 
                                in December 1994.

								It was initially based on Spyglass Mosaic. At various points, Internet Explorer was 
                                also available for MacOS, Solaris, and HP-UX. At its 1995 release, Internet Explorer 
                                competed with the Mosaic web browser and Netscape Navigator. Home Internet access was
                                still somewhat new and competed against proprietary services like CompuServe, AOL,
                                and Microsoft's own MSN.

							<h1>Cascading Style Sheets 1 (CSS 1)</h1>

                                working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. Several other style sheet languages for 
                                the web were proposed around the same time, and discussions on public mailing lists 
                                and inside World Wide Web Consortium resulted in the first W3C CSS Recommendation 
                                (CSS1) being released in 1996.

							<h1>HTML 3.2</h1>
							<p>
								W3C issued a final recommendation specifying the HTML 3.2 markup language. The original 
                                HTML 3.0 version had never become a standard, as it was too complicated, and the leading 
                                Microsoft and Netscape developers had a problem implementing it. <br><br>                              
                                W3C published official recommendations for the HTML 4.0 specification. The HTML 4.0 
                                specification was divided into three variants: Strict, Transitional, and Frameset, 
                                and its aim was to separate the HTML semantics and the document layout (formatted 
                                using only CSS) into two separate parts.

                                1999. The abstract of the specification reads, "This specification defines the 
                                HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the publishing language of the World Wide Web. 
                                This specification defines HTML 4.01, which is a subversion of HTML 4.

							<h1>Extensible HyperText Markup Language (XHTML)</h1>
							<p>
								XHTML is a markup language for creating hypertext documents in an Internet environment. 
                                XHTML originated from an integration of XML and HTML and was divided into three 
                                versions: Strict, Transitional, and Frameset. According to W3C's original plans, 
                                XHTML was supposed to be the successor to HTML, whose development was completed by 
                                version 4.01. However, in 2007, a new version of HTML started being developed, 
                                labeled HTML5.

							<h1>Audi.com, First Partially “Responsive” Website</h1>

								The website designed for Audi by the Razorfish digital agency was one of the first to 
                                modify its content based on the size of the web browser window. Audi.com was “optimized” 
                                for 640x480 px, 800x600 px and 1024x768 px. However, Audi.com was not a classic example 
                                of responsive web design as we know it today, but rather a dynamic customization of design 
                                using JavaScript, based on a detection of browser resolution.

                                7, 2003. Safari has become the browser of choice for millions of Mac® users and will 
                                be the default browser for all newly introduced Macintosh® computers, starting with 
                                the Power Mac® G5 announced today. Apple also released a software development kit that 
                                allows developers to embed the Safari HTML rendering engine directly into their 
                                applications.

								The project began as an experimental branch of the Mozilla project by Dave Hyatt,

                                browser. t was released on November 9, 2004, and challenged Internet Explorer's

                                Bootstrap 1 was released as an open source tool and is currently one of the most popular 
                                CSS frameworks among web designers. In January 2012, Bootstrap 2 was released, supporting
